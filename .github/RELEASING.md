# Releasing soroi

Open **Actions → Release → Run workflow**, select `main` or the matching
`release/<version>` branch, and enter a version such as `v0.3.2` or
`v0.3.2-alpha.0.1`. Both use `release/v0.3.2`; the branch must match the version
without its prerelease suffix. Leave **dry_run** unchecked to publish.

Pushes and pull requests targeting `main` or `release/**` run CI and security
checks. Website CI runs for pull requests and relevant pushed file changes.
Ordinary pushes do not publish tags or releases; publication remains manual.
Prereleases are marked as such on GitHub and do not replace the latest stable
release. Stable publication explicitly sets the latest release.

The workflow runs lint, formatting, module checks, race tests across Linux,
macOS, and Windows, builds, and vulnerability checks. A Codex Agent powered by
DeepSeek then reads the commits, diffs, and source since the previous release
and writes **English-only** release notes.

After validating the notes, a separate job creates an annotated Git tag at the
checked commit and publishes the GitHub Release. The agent has a read-only
sandbox and does not have the token used to publish releases.

To preview, enable **dry_run**. It runs the same checks and agent, then saves the
notes in the workflow summary and the `release-notes` artifact without creating
a tag or release. The preview still makes paid requests to DeepSeek.

## Configuration

Store the DeepSeek API key as the repository Actions secret `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
Do not put keys in repository files. The agent uses `deepseek-flash` through
DeepSeek's Responses API and the official `openai/codex-action` runner.

The release helpers are POSIX shell scripts using Git, jq, and GitHub CLI. These
tools are available on the GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner. Local verification:

```sh
sh .github/scripts/release_test.sh
```

## Versions and retries

Choose the version using the [version policy](../docs/versioning.en-US.md):

- During `v0`, use a patch for compatible fixes and a minor version for new
  features, deprecations, or breaking changes.
- From `v1`, use a patch for compatible fixes, a minor for compatible additions
  or deprecations, and a major for breaking changes. Deprecations must remain
  available for at least one minor release before removal in a later major.
- Raising the core library's minimum Go version requires a `v0` minor or, from
  `v1`, a major release. Update `go.mod`, CI, and the documented requirement.
- Breaking releases must include affected APIs or behavior and migration steps
  in the release notes. Check these before publishing, including generated notes.

Use a new `v0.x.y` or `v1.x.y` version, optionally followed by a SemVer prerelease
suffix such as `-alpha.0.1`. Numeric suffix identifiers must not have leading
zeroes. Build metadata is not supported. A `v2` release requires
updating the Go module and import paths and release validation first. The
workflow does not publish on ordinary commits.

An existing tag for another commit is rejected. If publication stops after
pushing the tag, rerun the workflow at the same commit and version. It reuses
that tag; an existing Release and its notes are preserved. Never move, delete,
or reuse a published Go module tag; publish corrections under a new version.

## v0.3.2 release

Version `v0.3.2` intentionally includes new query APIs despite its patch version:
subscription polling, grouped query subscriptions, and infinite queries. This is
an explicit exception to the patch feature policy. State the feature scope and
this exception in the release notes, including the `v0.3.2-alpha.0.1` preview.

## soroi rename release

Version `v0.3.1` is an explicit exception to patch compatibility: it changes the
module path, package name, and default Redis prefix. Include the bilingual
[cacheq migration instructions](../docs/versioning.en-US.md#migrating-from-cacheq-to-soroi)
in the release notes. Preserve all historical releases and tags.

Publish both `v0.3.1` and `store/redis/v0.3.1` at the same checked commit. The
release workflow publishes the root tag only; publish the adapter tag separately
so `github.com/Waterkyuu/soroi/store/redis@v0.3.1` can resolve.
