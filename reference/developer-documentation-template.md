# Developer guide template

Use this template when writing or rewriting a developer-facing guide in `docs/`.
Produce the finished guide. Replace every placeholder with verified content and
remove the writing instructions from the published document.

Read the relevant implementation, public API comments, tests, and call sites
before writing. Use the current repository's API names, defaults, supported
versions, and behavior. Keep the English and Chinese guides aligned.

## Required document structure

### 1. Title and introduction

```markdown
# <Feature name>

[Other language](<matching-language-file>)

<What this feature does, when an application needs it, and what this guide
will implement. Use one short paragraph and a concrete application scenario.>
```

Name the application data and operation. For example: two service instances
reuse a user's profile through Redis to avoid loading it twice from the database.
Do not open with internal architecture, implementation history, or a list of
abstract benefits.


### 3. API usage

```markdown
## Usage

### Create <resource>

<Explain what this operation creates, why the application needs it, which API
it uses, what the arguments represent, and what the returned object does.>

<Focused example of this operation, including error handling.>

<Explain the result and when it becomes useful to the next operation.>

### <Next operation, such as define a query or fetch a result>

<Explain this API's purpose, inputs, and returned result before the code.>

<Focused example reusing objects from the preceding operation.>
```

Organize the main explanation by operations such as "Create a shared cache",
"Define a query", "Fetch results", and "Invalidate cached data". Each operation
must have its own heading, a direct explanation, and a focused code example.
Do not substitute a large program with comments or a parameter table for these
API usage sections.

At each API's first use, explain its type argument, dependencies, concrete option
values, return value, error behavior, and whether it performs I/O. Explain how
its returned object connects to later calls. Introduce one operation at a time;
do not put every object's explanation into a single preamble.

Identify the origin of variables and helpers. State which file or function each
snippet extends and whether it is standalone. Introduce required result types
before using them as type arguments. Say which objects to reuse across requests,
who closes them, and when a callback is defined versus actually executed.

### 4. Complete runnable example

```markdown
## Complete example

Save the following program as `main.go` in <the configured module directory>.
It combines the operations above to <state the behavior demonstrated>.

<One complete Go program.>

Run it from <the working directory>:

<Exact run command.>

Expected output:

<Verified output.>

<Explain what in the output demonstrates success.>
```

Place the complete program after the focused API sections, either immediately
below them or in the final examples section. A short getting-started page may
lead with a runnable program; an API usage guide must explain operations first.

Include package, imports, result types, initialization, configuration, public
calls, result handling, error handling, and cleanup. State addresses and required
environment variables. Explain which values to replace in a real application.

Demonstrate the smallest useful scenario. For Redis sharing, show a source read
followed by another Client reusing the result. Keep optional capabilities in
separate API usage sections. Explain repeat-run behavior and demonstration-only
setup such as resetting a reserved cache record.

### 5. Configuration

```markdown
## Configuration

| Field | Purpose | Required or default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Exact API field> | <Effect on application behavior> | <Verified value> | <Units, validation, or interaction> |

<Concrete example explaining settings that are easy to confuse.>
```

Explain behavior instead of translating field names. For example, distinguish
local freshness from Redis retention with a timeline showing when a result
becomes stale. Identify zero-value behavior and incompatible option combinations.
Do not reproduce an entire implementation struct when a table is clearer.

### 6. Error handling and common problems

```markdown
## Error handling and common problems

| Symptom | Cause to check | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <Observable problem> | <Specific configuration or behavior> | <Concrete diagnostic or correction> |
```

Explain which failures return errors, which fall back or retain existing data,
and how the application can observe them. Include cancellation and timeouts when
relevant. Provide diagnostic calls or short error-handling snippets where needed.
Do not provide a list of error names without explaining what the caller should do.

### 7. Behavior and limitations

```markdown
## Behavior and limitations

<Caller-visible guarantees and boundaries that affect application decisions.>
```

Cover relevant freshness, concurrency, consistency, and resource ownership rules.
Explain mechanisms through their observable effects. For example, a cache write
rejected after invalidation can still return successful source data while leaving
the local result stale. Put detailed protocol explanations in a separate design
reference when needed. Do not imply unsupported guarantees.

### 8. Complete examples and related guides

```markdown
## Complete examples and related guides

- [<Maintained example>](<source-path>): <what additional scenario it demonstrates>.
- [<Related guide>](<guide-path>): <when the reader needs it>.
```

The complete program must work without following these links. Omit sections that do
not apply to the feature; do not invent content to fill the structure.

## Chinese section headings

Use the same section order and examples in both languages:

| English | Simplified Chinese |
| --- | --- |
| Installation | 安装 |
| Complete example | 完整示例 |
| Usage | 使用方式 |
| Configuration | 配置说明 |
| Error handling and common problems | 错误处理与常见问题 |
| Behavior and limitations | 行为与限制 |
| Complete examples and related guides | 完整示例与相关文档 |

## Completion requirements

- Compile and run the complete program from the documented setup; verify output.
- Verify later snippets in their stated context. Do not leave undefined helpers,
  missing imports, ellipses, or unhandled setup errors in runnable examples.
- Keep code comments in English and follow repository declaration-comment rules.
- Check both languages for matching APIs, defaults, code, outputs, and limitations.
- Remove author instructions, placeholders, research notes, and source-comparison
  commentary from the finished guide.
- Follow repository checks. For website guide changes, build both locales and
  verify links, navigation, and search. Keep unrelated documents unchanged.
