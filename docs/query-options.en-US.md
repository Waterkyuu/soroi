# Shared query options and reusable definitions

[简体中文](query-options.zh-CN.md)

`QueryOptions` is the shared configuration accepted by `Query`, `Fetch`, and `Prefetch`. It overrides Client defaults for freshness, retries, timeouts, and execution budgets. `Disable` controls only Query's automatic loading; explicit `Fetch`, `Prefetch`, and handle `Refetch` still execute.

`QueryDefinition(key, fetcher, options...)` returns `(Definition[V], error)`, inferring the result type `V` from the loader. Handle the construction error before using the reusable definition. Construction performs no loading and creates no cache or subscription.

## Quick start: reuse one configuration

This complete example gives all three entry points the same one-hour freshness policy. The disabled subscription receives data loaded explicitly by `Prefetch`, and `Fetch` reuses that fresh data. Client defaults remain unchanged. Save the program as `main.go` in a module importing soroi and run `go run .`.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/Waterkyuu/soroi"
)

// main reuses one loading policy across subscription, prefetch, and explicit reads.
func main() {
	client := soroi.NewClient(soroi.Options{StaleTime: time.Minute})
	defer client.Close()
	ctx := context.Background()
	load := func(context.Context) (string, error) { return "hello", nil }
	hour := time.Hour
	options := soroi.QueryOptions{Disable: true, StaleTime: &hour}
	query := soroi.Query(client, "greeting", load, options)
	defer query.Close()
	if err := soroi.Prefetch(ctx, client, "greeting", load, options); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	value, err := soroi.Fetch(ctx, client, "greeting", load, options)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(value)
	fmt.Println("observed:", query.Snapshot().Data)
}
```

Expected output:

```text
hello
observed: hello
```

## Automatic loading and explicit reads

`Query(client, key, load, options)` copies its policy at construction. Automatic loads, `SetEnabled`, and manual `Refetch` retain that policy.

| Entry point | Effect of `Disable: true` |
| --- | --- |
| `Query` | Subscribe to shared updates without starting automatic loads |
| `Fetch` | Perform an explicit read; fresh cache data can satisfy it |
| `Prefetch` | Warm the cache explicitly using the same loading policy |
| Handle `Refetch` | Permit explicit refreshing even while disabled |

Omitting options, passing `QueryOptions{}`, or leaving `Disable` false permits automatic loading. Disabling a handle does not cancel shared work or disable other handles. Later changes to the original options do not change an existing handle; use `SetEnabled(bool)` instead.

`Fetch(ctx, client, key, load, options)` and `Prefetch(ctx, client, key, load, options)` apply configuration only to that call. Both ignore `Disable`. They neither change Client defaults nor register a policy for later calls using the same key. `Prefetch` returns loading errors without returning data or creating an ongoing subscription.

## `QueryDefinition`: define a typed query once

`QueryDefinition` accepts a query key, a typed loader, and zero or one `QueryOptions` value. It returns `(Definition[V], error)` without executing the loader or validating the key. Key and result-type validation occurs when an operation uses a Client. Omitting options or passing `QueryOptions{}` uses Client defaults; nil fields inherit their corresponding defaults. Extra configurations immediately return a zero `Definition[V]` and `ErrTooManyOptions`; no error state is retained inside a definition. Configure `Shared` and `Tags` on the returned definition before use.

The returned definition has five exported fields:

| Field | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Key` | Identify the query using a non-nil comparable key; include all query parameters and identity scope |
| `Fetcher` | Load `V` using the application's HTTP, database, or other dependencies |
| `Shared` | Optionally reuse serialized results through a [shared result cache](shared-cache.en-US.md); nil keeps caching local |
| `Tags` | Declare labels for grouping related queries; registration and lifetime follow the [query tag contract](query-tags.en-US.md) |
| `Options` | Supply the same `QueryOptions` to reading, subscribing, and prefetching |

Each operation receives a Client explicitly. The Client owns cached data, shared requests, and shutdown. The same definition can be used with multiple Clients, whose caches remain independent. The returned query handle must be closed by its caller.

This complete example demonstrates definition construction, prefetching, cache reuse, and explicit invalidation:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/Waterkyuu/soroi"
)

// main reuses a typed definition without creating a second cache or automatic loading.
func main() {
	client := soroi.NewClient(soroi.Options{})
	defer client.Close()
	ctx := context.Background()
	hour := time.Hour
	calls := 0
	definition, err := soroi.QueryDefinition("greeting", func(context.Context) (string, error) {
		calls++
		return "hello", nil
	}, soroi.QueryOptions{Disable: true, StaleTime: &hour})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	query := definition.Query(client)
	defer query.Close()
	fmt.Println("initial calls:", calls)
	if err := definition.Prefetch(ctx, client); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	value, err := definition.Fetch(ctx, client)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(value, "calls:", calls)
	if err := client.Invalidate(definition.Key); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	if _, err := definition.Fetch(ctx, client); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("refreshed calls:", calls)
}
```

Expected output:

```text
initial calls: 0
hello calls: 1
refreshed calls: 2
```

| Method | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `definition.Fetch(ctx, client)` | `(V, error)` with the same contract as `Fetch` |
| `definition.Query(client)` | `*QueryHandle[V]` with the same contract as `Query` |
| `definition.Prefetch(ctx, client)` | Loading error with the same contract as `Prefetch` |

The former `QueryDefinition` struct has been replaced by the function. Create definitions with function calls and handle the returned error; use `Definition[V]` in explicit variable, parameter, and return type declarations. Typed loaders infer `V`, including typed nil loaders. A bare nil loader has no result type to infer; specify a type argument, such as `soroi.QueryDefinition[string]("greeting", nil)`, when needed. A nil loader follows the existing operation contracts; it cannot load missing or stale data.

The methods use the definition's key, fetcher, and options directly. To customize one consumer, copy the definition and change the copy's options before calling a method. Changes to Key, Fetcher, or Options apply to subsequent operations without reconfiguring existing handles. Tags declared by subsequent operations are merged into the shared query state. Each method reads option pointer values when its operation starts. Applications must synchronize shared definitions, pointer values, and mutable state captured by loaders.

Definitions do not infer keys from a loader, add authorization checks, or serialize business operations. Build parameterized definitions in ordinary business functions so the key and loader capture matching parameters. Result-type binding, cancellation, errors, and in-flight request sharing follow the existing [query contracts](queries.en-US.md). Use `client.Invalidate(definition.Key)` or `client.InvalidateAndWait(ctx, definition.Key)` for explicit invalidation.

## Subscription polling

`RefetchInterval` is a subscription-only `time.Duration`. Positive values enable fixed-interval refreshes for `Query` and `Definition.Query`; zero or negative values disable polling. `Fetch` and `Prefetch` ignore it. Handles copy the interval at construction. Use the existing `SetEnabled` and `Close` methods to manage polling ownership.

Same-key subscribers share the shortest positive interval among enabled handles; the oldest handle with that interval supplies its loading policy. Active loads cause intervals to be skipped without queuing work. See [subscription polling](polling.en-US.md) for the runnable task-progress example and lifecycle rules.

## Shared fields

These loading-policy fields apply to `Query`, `Fetch`, and `Prefetch`.

| Field | Type | Default | When set |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `StaleTime` | `*time.Duration` | Inherit Client freshness | Calculate freshness from the data's `UpdatedAt`; zero means immediately stale |
| `Retry` | `*int` | Inherit Client retry count | Additional attempts after the first failure; zero or negative disables retries |
| `RetryIf` | `func(error) bool` | Inherit Client error filter | True permits an additional attempt, subject to the retry count and terminal errors |
| `RetryDelay` | `func(int) time.Duration` | Inherit Client retry delay | Return the delay before an additional attempt; numbering starts at 1 |
| `Timeout` | `*time.Duration` | Inherit Client load timeout | Bound the entire load, including queuing, execution, and retry delays; zero or negative adds no timeout |
| `Executor` | `*Executor` | nil, inherit Client budget | Use this shared budget for new loader attempts |
| `DisableExecutor` | `bool` | false | Skip the outer Client budget; takes precedence over `Executor` |

Pointer fields distinguish inheritance from explicit zero values. For example, `Retry: nil` inherits the default retry count; a pointer to 0 disables retries. Caller context deadlines and cancellation remain effective even with a zero `Timeout`.

Cancellation, deadline errors, `ErrQueueFull`, `ErrBatcherClosed`, and `ErrExecutionReentry` never retry, including wrapped errors, and bypass `RetryIf`. The predicate runs only when attempts remain and the error is retryable. A predicate always returning true can override the Client filter but cannot bypass terminal errors.

`RetryIf` and `RetryDelay` run outside the Client lock and may call Client APIs. Applications must synchronize shared mutable state captured by callbacks.

## Execution budget overrides

Use `Executor` to select a different backend budget for one query, or `DisableExecutor: true` when its Batcher already budgets the actual bulk callback. A nil Executor inherits the Client budget unless disabling is explicit. Disabling outer acquisition does not disable the Batcher's own budget.

```go
options := soroi.QueryOptions{
	DisableExecutor: true,
}
```

Pass this same configuration to `Query`, `Fetch`, or `Prefetch` when using `Batcher.Fetcher`. Applying the same budget at both layers returns `ErrExecutionReentry` when the callback context is propagated. See [execution budgets](execution.en-US.md) for a complete configuration example and detection limitations.

## Defaults and overrides

Query, fetch, prefetch, definition construction, mutation construction, and invalidation entry points accept zero or one configuration. Omitted and empty configurations use the same defaults. Put all overrides in one struct; multiple configurations produce `ErrTooManyOptions` at runtime before operation side effects. The deprecated `FetchWithOptions` entry point remains removed; use `Fetch`.

- Omitting options or passing `QueryOptions{}` uses Client defaults. `QueryOptions.Disable` defaults to false.
- Each operation accepts at most one configuration. Extra values are rejected at runtime rather than merged or discarded. Nil policy fields inherit Client defaults.
- Duration and retry pointer values are copied when creating `Query` or calling `Fetch` or `Prefetch`. A definition retains option pointers until one of these operations applies them. Later changes to the original variables do not alter existing configuration. Executor references are shared; capacity is not copied.
- The same key still shares data and requests. Different options do not create separate caches or replace query parameters and identity scope in the key.

## Configuration errors

More than one configuration is reported as `ErrTooManyOptions`, which supports `errors.Is`. Rejected operations do not load data, register subscriptions or tags, invalidate local state, or call shared storage.

| Entry point | Error delivery |
| --- | --- |
| `Fetch`, `Prefetch`, and invalidation methods | Returned error |
| `Query` | Failed handle: `Snapshot().Err`, initial `Updates()` state, and `Refetch` |
| `Mutation` | Failed handle: `Snapshot().Err`, initial `Updates()` state, and `Mutate` |
| `QueryDefinition` | Immediately returns a zero `Definition[V]` and `ErrTooManyOptions` from the constructor |

Invalid query and mutation handles publish one error state and close their update channels. `QueryDefinition` reports configuration errors directly at construction. Check its returned error before setting fields or calling methods; definitions have no retained constructor error.

## Configuration for shared requests

A new load uses its initiator's loader, retry settings, timeout, and execution budget. Later same-key calls do not replace them. A joiner's context can end its own wait, but its `Timeout` setting applies only to new loads it initiates.

Automatic refresh after invalidation uses the oldest still-enabled handle's configuration. After that handle closes or is disabled, the next enabled handle supplies future automatic refreshes. Manual `Refetch` uses the current handle's configuration when starting a new load.

## Cache policy limits

`StaleTime` changes ordinary cache freshness decisions without enabling polling. Without a positive `RefetchInterval`, passing time does not automatically publish notifications or start requests; `Snapshot()` reevaluates state when read. `Get` and calls to `Fetch` or `Prefetch` with omitted or empty options use Client freshness defaults.

Explicit invalidation and failed refreshes that install no new data make ordinary cached data stale for all queries. Absolute deadlines returned through `FetchWithExpiry` are unaffected by `StaleTime` overrides, including explicitly cached fallback data and errors.

The Client owns cache capacity, `MaxAge`, GC, and the clock. A longer `StaleTime` cannot extend data availability beyond `MaxAge`.
