# Queries, shared data, and conditional loading

[简体中文](queries.zh-CN.md) · [Cache and lifecycle](cache.en-US.md) · [Invalidation](invalidation.en-US.md)

One `Client` manages different result types. `Query` subscribes to cached state and background loading; `Fetch` waits for fresh data without retaining a subscription. Both infer their result type from the loader and share data and active requests for the same key. `Queries` observes independent subscriptions through one ordered stream; `QueriesWithCombine` optionally projects their states, for example to a TUI dashboard's data, loading state, and errors.

## Quick start: multiple result types

Save this complete program as `main.go` in a module importing soroi, then run `go run .`. The fixed loaders demonstrate typing; an actual HTTP loader appears below.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	soroi "github.com/Waterkyuu/soroi"
)

// User is a detail result and an element of a list result.
type User struct {
	// Name contains the user's display name.
	Name string
}

// Settings contains application configuration independent of user data.
type Settings struct {
	// Theme selects the application's appearance.
	Theme string
}

// main shares one application-owned client across differently typed queries.
func main() {
	client := soroi.NewClient(soroi.Options{
		StaleTime: time.Minute,
		GCTime:    5 * time.Minute,
	})
	defer client.Close()

	getUser := func(context.Context) (User, error) {
		return User{Name: "Alice"}, nil
	}
	getUsers := func(context.Context) ([]User, error) {
		return []User{{Name: "Alice"}}, nil
	}
	getSettings := func(context.Context) (Settings, error) {
		return Settings{Theme: "dark"}, nil
	}
	detail := soroi.Query(client, "user:42", getUser)
	users := soroi.Query(client, "users", getUsers)
	settings := soroi.Query(client, "settings", getSettings)
	defer detail.Close()
	defer users.Close()
	defer settings.Close()

	// Fetch reuses fresh data or joins the active load started by Query.
	user, err := soroi.Fetch(
		context.Background(),
		client,
		"user:42",
		getUser,
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(user.Name)
	listState := users.Snapshot()        // Snapshot[[]User]
	settingsState := settings.Snapshot() // Snapshot[Settings]
	_ = listState
	_ = settingsState
}
```

Expected output:

```text
Alice
```

Each key has one static result type: `"user:42"` stores `User`; `"users"` stores `[]User`. Include all parameters, tenants, and identities affecting a result in its key. Strings, integers, and comparable structs are supported. Keys must equal themselves under Go equality. Nil keys, slices, maps, and NaN values (including structs, arrays, or complex values containing NaN) return `ErrInvalidKey`. Invalid keys cannot create cache entries, loads, or subscriptions; target lists are validated before any changes. Sharing is in-process; this is not automatic cross-service synchronization.

## API snippet prerequisites

The following partial snippets use `client`, `getUser`, `getUsers`, and `getSettings` from the quick start and a non-nil `ctx`. Place snippets containing `return err` inside a function returning `error`. Each snippet is independent; add the imports it uses.

## `Query`: current data and background loading

```go
users := soroi.Query(client, "users", getUsers)
defer users.Close()
state := users.Snapshot()

```

Missing data starts an initial request. Fresh data is reused. Stale data remains available while a background request runs. Neither `Query` nor `Snapshot()` waits for HTTP completion. A snapshot is a value; a previously returned variable does not update itself.

Omitting options, supplying `soroi.QueryOptions{}`, or leaving `Disable` false enables loading. Set `Disable: true` to disable automatic loading. Configuration is optional and limited to one value; extras produce `ErrTooManyOptions` on the failed handle. Construction failures appear in `Snapshot().Err` and the initial `Updates()` value; the failed handle's channel then closes.

## `Updates`: receive the latest state

```go
for state := range users.Updates() {
	if state.Err != nil {
		// Report the error while retaining any available old data.
	}
	if state.HasData {
		// Forward state.Data to the application's UI or event loop.
	}
}
```

The channel provides initial and subsequent latest states. Request transitions, writes, and invalidation can publish updates. Slow consumers may skip intermediate states, so this is not an event log. The application must release the handle from an independent shutdown path: a `defer` after a blocking `range` cannot itself end that range.

## `Queries`: observe multiple independent queries

### Create a group from typed definitions

`Queries(client, definitions...)` returns `*QueriesHandle[[]Snapshot[any]]` without waiting for loads. Its `QuerySpec` inputs are existing `Definition[V]` values and may have different result types. Each member keeps its own `QueryOptions`, tags, shared cache, and static result-type binding. Loading, same-key request sharing, retries, and polling follow `Query` rules.

Append the following two snippets at the end of `main` in the quick start, after `_ = settingsState`. `QueryDefinition` infers `User` and `Settings` from the existing loaders; it performs no I/O and returns an error if extra configuration values are supplied. The group shares data and in-flight work with the subscriptions already created there.

```go
userDefinition, err := soroi.QueryDefinition("user:42", getUser)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
settingsDefinition, err := soroi.QueryDefinition("settings", getSettings)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
group := soroi.Queries(client, userDefinition, settingsDefinition)
defer group.Close()
```

### Read ordered query states

`group.Snapshot()` returns the current `[]Snapshot[any]`; `group.Updates()` streams initial and subsequent latest slices. Each input keeps one position, including duplicate keys and construction failures. The library does not choose aggregate readiness, loading, or error rules. Check each result's `HasData` before asserting its dynamic data type. This example prints once both initial loads finish; a TUI can continue receiving states for the view's lifetime.

```go
for results := range group.Updates() {
	for _, result := range results {
		if result.Err != nil {
			panic(result.Err)
		}
	}
	ready := results[0].HasData && results[1].HasData
	fetching := results[0].Fetching || results[1].Fetching
	if ready && !fetching {
		user := results[0].Data.(User)
		settings := results[1].Data.(Settings)
		fmt.Println(user.Name, settings.Theme)
		break
	}
}
```

Run the extended complete program with `go run .`. Expected output:

```text
Alice
Alice dark
```

### Define an optional combined result

`QueriesWithCombine(client, combine, definitions...)` uses the same subscriptions and returns `*QueriesHandle[R]`, where the callback's return type determines `R`. `Snapshot()` and `Updates()` expose that type. Append this snippet after the previous loop to combine the two queries into `Combined`, preserving their data and collecting loading states and errors:

```go
// Combined keeps query data alongside the view's loading state and errors.
type Combined struct {
	// Data preserves the input order of the queries.
	Data []any
	// Pending reports an initial load without previous data.
	Pending bool
	// Fetching includes initial loads and background refreshes.
	Fetching bool
	// Errors contains every non-nil query error.
	Errors []error
}

combined := soroi.QueriesWithCombine(
	client,
	func(results []soroi.Snapshot[any]) Combined {
		state := Combined{
			Data:   make([]any, len(results)),
			Errors: []error{},
		}
		for i, result := range results {
			state.Data[i] = result.Data
			state.Pending = state.Pending || result.Status == soroi.Pending
			state.Fetching = state.Fetching || result.Fetching
			if result.Err != nil {
				state.Errors = append(state.Errors, result.Err)
			}
		}
		return state
	},
	userDefinition,
	settingsDefinition,
)
defer combined.Close()
state := combined.Snapshot()
fmt.Println("data:", state.Data)
fmt.Println("pending:", state.Pending)
fmt.Println("fetching:", state.Fetching)
fmt.Println("errors:", state.Errors)
```

Additional output:

```text
data: [{Alice} {dark}]
pending: false
fetching: false
errors: []
```

`Data` retains one position per query. `Pending` reports any initial load without previous data; `Fetching` also includes background refreshes. `Errors` collects non-nil errors. Both `Snapshot()` and values received from `Updates()` expose these fields as `Combined`.

Update projections run serially on one worker outside the Client lock; default `Queries` uses no projection worker. `Snapshot()` calls the callback synchronously and may overlap update projection or other reads. Callbacks must return promptly and synchronize any captured mutable state. Slow callbacks and consumers can skip intermediate states. `Close` releases subscriptions immediately and returns without waiting; the combined update channel closes after already-captured projections finish. A nil callback panics before creating subscriptions.

### Behavior and ownership

One failure leaves sibling queries running and preserves their partial results. Each result retains its own error and any still-usable old data. Invalid keys, result-type conflicts, missing fetchers, and nil definitions appear in their result positions; nil definitions report `ErrNoFetcher`. Empty groups and groups containing only construction failures publish one slice and close the raw stream; a combined handle projects that slice before closing its output.

Returned slices belong to the caller; query data inside them remains shared and immutable. Reads and newly built updates apply each member's freshness and `MaxAge` rules. Merely passing time does not publish an update. Members remain independent; the group provides no transaction across keys and does not merge backend calls into a batch. See [automatic batch loading](batching.en-US.md) for `Batcher` and `LoadMany`.

The group is fixed at construction. Use existing Client invalidation and cancellation APIs for its keys; releasing and recreating a group changes its members or copied options. `Close` is idempotent and releases only this group's subscriptions and polling ownership. In-flight work and other consumers continue. `Client.Close` also releases the group. An external shutdown path must end a long-running receive loop.

## `SetEnabled`: load only when a condition permits

```go
users := soroi.Query(
	client,
	"users",
	getUsers,
	soroi.QueryOptions{
		Disable: true,
	},
)
defer users.Close()

// Called by the application's login-state change handler.
if err := users.SetEnabled(true); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

Disabled handles do not start initial or invalidation-triggered requests. They still read cached data and receive updates produced by other consumers. Enabling loads missing or stale data. Go does not watch a boolean variable, so update permission explicitly. Each handle has its own permission; disabling one neither disables another nor cancels an existing request.

## `Refetch`: manually refresh with the retained fetcher

```go
updatedUsers, err := users.Refetch(ctx)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
_ = updatedUsers
```

This waits for a result regardless of freshness or enablement, sharing an existing same-key request if one is running. Released handles return `ErrQueryClosed`.

## `Fetch`: wait for fresh data without a subscription

```go
users, err := soroi.Fetch(
	ctx,
	client,
	"users",
	getUsers,
)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
_ = users // []User

```

Fresh cached results return immediately; stale or missing results wait for a load. Use this in HTTP handlers, jobs, or business steps requiring the result. It shares data and in-flight work with `Query`. `Fetcher[V]` is a `func(context.Context) (V, error)` business loader. Create the client once at the application boundary and inject it into request handlers.

## Snapshot fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Data` | Current or retained previous data |
| `HasData` | Distinguishes usable zero values from absent data |
| `Status` | `Idle`, `Pending`, `Success`, or `Error` |
| `Err` | Latest failure; previous usable data can remain available |
| `Stale` | Missing, expired, or explicitly invalidated data |
| `Fetching` | Active initial load or background refresh |
| `UpdatedAt` | Last installation of usable data |
| `ExpiresAt` | Absolute freshness deadline; zero after invalidation |

`Pending` means an initial request is running without old data. A disabled missing query is `Idle`. Result status and request activity are separate: background refresh can be `Success` with `Fetching: true`. Becoming stale does not itself start a request or publish a timed update; this is not polling.

For periodic refreshes, set a positive `QueryOptions.RefetchInterval`. Polling runs while an enabled polling subscriber remains and reuses this state channel. See [subscription polling](query-options.en-US.md#subscription-polling) for interval configuration and subscription lifecycle rules.

## HTTP cancellation

The following loader needs `context`, `encoding/json`, `fmt`, and `net/http`. `endpoint` is the application's user-list URL.

```go
getUsers := func(ctx context.Context) ([]User, error) {
	request, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(
		ctx,
		http.MethodGet,
		endpoint,
		nil,
	)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("create users request: %w", err)
	}
	response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(request)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("fetch users: %w", err)
	}
	defer response.Body.Close()
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("fetch users: HTTP %d", response.StatusCode)
	}
	users := []User{}
	if err := json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(&users); err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("decode users: %w", err)
	}
	return users, nil
}
```

Automatic `Query` work belongs to the client. Loads started by `Fetch` or manual `Refetch` belong to the starting caller's context. A waiting caller's cancellation ends only its wait. If the owner cancels, remaining callers may start a replacement request. Closing a handle releases its subscription without canceling shared work; `client.Cancel` and `client.Close` cancel requests. Loaders must honor their context. `Options.Timeout` bounds the complete load, including retries and backoff.

## Bubble Tea integration

The [Bubble Tea guide](bubbletea.en-US.md) documents the runnable task board,
keyboard controls, message-loop integration, and cleanup. It uses Bubble Tea v2
in an independent module requiring Go 1.26; the core library supports Go 1.22.

The [model](../examples/bubbletea/model.go) waits for one `Updates()` notification
in a `tea.Cmd`, sends the snapshot to `Update`, then schedules the next wait.
Only the message loop mutates display state.

## Verification

```sh
go test -race ./e2e -run 'Test(SharedClientMutation|ConditionalConsumers|HTTPSharedBackgroundLoad)' -count=1
```

[The lifecycle e2e suite](../e2e/query_lifecycle_test.go) runs an isolated local HTTP service and verifies heterogeneous results, mutation refresh, enablement, and request sharing.
