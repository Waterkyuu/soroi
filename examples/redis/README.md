# Redis shared cache examples

Requires Go 1.26+ and a local `redis-server` executable. This independent module
uses local `replace` directives for the repository's soroi core and Redis
adapter, keeping example dependencies separate from the library modules.

Start a disposable Redis server in one terminal:

```sh
redis-server --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 16379 --save '' --appendonly no
```

From the repository root, run a program in another terminal:

```sh
cd examples/redis
REDIS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:16379 go run ./shared_cache_minimal
REDIS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:16379 go run ./shared_cache
REDIS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:16379 go run ./shared_invalidation
```

`REDIS_ADDR` defaults to `127.0.0.1:6379`. Stop the disposable server with Ctrl+C
when finished. Use the reserved demonstration namespaces only for these examples.

| Program | Behavior | Guide and expected output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [shared_cache_minimal](shared_cache_minimal/main.go) | Three sequential reads show a source load, a Redis hit, and a local hit | [Minimal shared cache demo](../../docs/shared-cache.en-US.md#minimal-two-client-demo) · [简体中文](../../docs/shared-cache.zh-CN.md#两个-client-的最小示例) |
| [shared_cache](shared_cache/main.go) | Two local Clients reuse Redis results; key invalidation refreshes data; Redis failures fall back to the source | [Shared result cache](../../docs/shared-cache.en-US.md) · [简体中文](../../docs/shared-cache.zh-CN.md) |
| [shared_invalidation](shared_invalidation/main.go) | Two Clients reuse detail and list results; remote tag invalidation notifies the second Client and marks both results stale | [Shared invalidation](../../docs/shared-invalidation.en-US.md) · [简体中文](../../docs/shared-invalidation.zh-CN.md) |
| [failure_protection](failure_protection/main.go) | A closed Redis client forces fallback; a shared Executor rejects another key while local hits remain available | [Failure protection](../../docs/shared-cache.en-US.md#protect-the-source-during-cache-failures) · [简体中文](../../docs/shared-cache.zh-CN.md#缓存故障期间保护数据源) |

The failure protection example requires no Redis server. From `examples/redis`, run:

```sh
go run ./failure_protection
```

Expected output:

```text
local hit: cached
second rejected: true
first: loaded
source calls: 1
rejected: 1
shared read errors: 1
```

The closed client models immediate transport failure, not a slow Redis server.
The budget covers the entire load attempt, including Redis access and writeback.
Its limit applies to this process; replicas need separately sized budgets.

Start with `shared_cache_minimal` to follow the basic read path. It prints once
when the simulated database is called and reports shared-cache hits after each
read. Each Client owns its own local cache.

The `shared_cache` and `shared_invalidation` programs use an atomic in-memory
authoritative source to make changes and source call counts observable. They reset
their reserved demonstration key or tag before each run. The first program disables remote notifications; the second
enables remote tags and notifications and waits for stale snapshots before
explicitly refreshing data.

The Redis adapter implementation and integration tests remain in
[store/redis](../../store/redis/). Build and inspect the example module separately
because root Go commands do not traverse nested modules:

```sh
go mod verify
go vet ./...
go build ./...
```
